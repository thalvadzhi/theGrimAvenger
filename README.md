theGrimAvenger
==============

Idea:
-----
- Character will move sideways, will be able to jump over obstacles, will be able to hide in shadows. Also deal damage with utilities. Main goal will be to reach the end of the level without being detected. The levels themselves will just be a brief demo of the engine. 

Character:
----------
  - character representation 
  - ragdoll system
  - possibly implement a fighting system
  - implement stealth so batman can hide in the shadows 
  - implement batman utility belt( batarangs, grapling hook, etc.) 
  - also do physics
    - gravity 
    - collision 
    - gliding feature for batman 
    - behaviour for utilities(batarang, grapling hook)
  - also NPCs 
    - batman detectability
    - behaviour(pseudo-AI) 

Environment:
------------
  - with obstacles to make it a bit of a challenge for batman 
  - utilize shadows for batman to hide in 
  - implement dynamic elements such as bats randomly flying off 

Game features:
--------------
  - minimap
  - stats system 
  - main menu and submenus
  - artwork(draw batman, environment, etc)
  - levels of difficulty(more observant NPCs)

Technologies:
-------------
  - python
  - pygame

For the second milestone:
-------------------------
  - character representation 
    - ragdoll system closer to final product
    - ragdoll motions in development
    - application of some basic laws of physics
  - level implementation closer to final product
  - batman utilities closer to final product
  - artwork
